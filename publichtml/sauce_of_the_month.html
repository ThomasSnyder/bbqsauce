<h2>4th Horsemen</h2>

<p>Do we have a treat for you with this month's special sauce. Deep within the pages of the sauce bible lies the key to death itself.
    we often refer to death as a sweet release and so that's exactly what we did with this sauce. So we took what we knew about bbq sauce and gave
it some love with sugar, apples, and honey. Although, if we kept this sweet we would've called it a kiss. So to stay true to it's name we gave it a bite.
    With our special mix of secret peppers the sauce will make its name known, as the 4th horsemen.</p>
